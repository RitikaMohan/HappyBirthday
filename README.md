# HappyBirthday App ðŸŽ‰
HappyBirthday is a simple Android application with two screens: a Splash Screen and a Main Screen. The app plays a unique video and audio on each screen, creating a personalized celebration experience.

## Features
#### Splash Screen:
  - Displays a video with accompanying audio as a warm-up to the main event.
  - Automatically transitions to the main screen once the splash video finishes.
#### Main Screen:
  - Displays another video and plays a complementary audio track.
  - Automatically closes the app once the main video ends.
#### Seamless Transitions:
  - The app smoothly transitions from the splash screen to the main screen without user intervention.

## How It Works
#### Splash Screen:
  1. Plays a video (splash_video1.mp4) and audio (audio1.mp3).
  2. On completion, transitions to the main screen.
#### Main Screen:
  1. Plays a video (main_video.mp4) and audio (audio2.mp3).
  2. Closes the app automatically when the video finishes.
